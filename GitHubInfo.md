# Git Hub Info

I use GitKraken because that is what I have used in the past, feel free to use whatever interface you are comfortable with and I can do my best to help you. I have found GitKraken useful for keeping track of changes I make to files and for interacting with GitHub. 
1. Download GitKraken (https://www.gitkraken.com/download). You can watch the intro video that comes up after clicking download, but it goes into more detail than anything I have used (however my knowledge is far more limited than what GitKraken can do)
2. Log in to GitKraken with your GitHub account.
3. Our lab organization is SWFREC-Soil-Microbiology with repository Soil-Microbiology.
4. From lab repository click the green *Code* button and copy the URL in the box (https://github.com/SWFREC-Soil-Microbiology/Soil-Microbiology.git). 
5. In GitKraken click the folder icon in the top left corner. Click *Clone* and select *Clone with URL*. There will be two dialog boxes: *Where to clone* and *URL*. Decide where on your device you want GitKraken to place the directory. Paste the URL copied from step 3 into *URL*. *Full Path* is what the full path will be on your computer once you have cloned it. The default is the same name as the repository. Click *Clone the repo!* <br>
a. Cloning copies the directory and its contents to your computer as well as establishes a link between the GitHub repository and your computer.
6. You should see a banner in GitKraken saying *Successfully cloned repo* if cloning worked. 
7. You can select *Open now* to view the repository in GitKraken. You can access it and any other repositories you have cloned by clicking the folder icon > Open > Open a Repository and navigating to your cloned directory. 
8. After this, you likely won't interact with GitKraken except to commit, push, and pull from the GitHub repository. 

## Commit and Push
Saving new files and editing existing files to the directory on your computer will be detected by GitKraken. You should see *file change in working directory*. Clicking *view change* allows you to stage and commit the changes (i.e. save a snapshot of the current state of the project). Stage the file and add a commit message. To commit anything, you are required to add a summary or description in the *Commit Message* area. This is helpful for version control, so you and others know at a glance what changed between each version. The most recent commit message will appear next to the filename on GitHub, and previous versions will appear in history for that file on GitHub. This does not need to be detailed, just short but meaningful. Then click *Commit changes to file*. <br> 
Committing does not put the changes on the GitHub repository. <br>
To get these files/changes to the repository, you need to perform a PUSH. Click *Push* at top of screen and file changes will appear on GitHub. You will get a banner on the bottom left saying *Pushed successfully*. <br>

## Viewing changes within one file over time
GitKraken is also great for viewing file changes over time. By clicking a file in GitKraken, select *Diff View* and *Split View*. GitKraken will highlight changes between the current and previous versions.
